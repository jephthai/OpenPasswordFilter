Introduction
------------
OpenPasswordFilter is an open source custom password filter DLL and userspace service to better protect / control Active Directory domain passwords.

The genesis of this idea comes from conducting many penetration tests where organizations have users who choose common passwords
and the ultimate difficulty of controlling this behavior.  The fact is that any domain of size will have some user who chose
`Password1` or `Summer2015` or `Company123` as their password.  Any intruder or low-privilege user who can guess or obtain
usernames for the domain can easily run through these very common passwords and start expanding the level of access in the 
domain.

Microsoft provides a wonderful feature in Active Directory, which is the ability to create a custom password filter DLL.  This
DLL is loaded by LSASS on boot (if configured), and will be queried for each new password users attempt to set.  The DLL simply
replies with a `TRUE` or `FALSE`, as appropriate, to indicate that the password passes or fails the test.  

There are some commercial options, but they are usually in the "call for pricing" category, and that makes it a little 
prohibitive for some organizations to implement truly effective preventive controls for this class of very common bad passwords. 

This is where OpenPasswordFilter comes in -- an open source solution to add basic dictionary-based rejection of common
passwords.

OPF is comprised of two main parts:

   1. OpenPasswordFilter.dll -- this is a custom password filter DLL that can be loaded by LSASS to vet incoming password changes.
   2. OPFService.exe -- this is a C#-based service binary that provides a local user-space service for maintaining the dictionary and servicing requests.
  
The DLL communicates with the service on the loopback network interface to check passwords against the configured database
of forbidden values.  This architecture is selected because it is difficult to reload the DLL after boot, and administrators
are likely loathe to reboot their DCs when they want to add another forbidden password to the list.  Just bear in mind how this
architecture works so you understand what's going on.

**NOTE** The current version is very ALPHA!  I have tested it on some of my DCs, but your mileage may vary and you may wish to
test in a safe location before using this in real life.

Installation
------------
You can download a precompiled 64-bit version of OPF from the following link:

[OPF-alpha.zip](https://github.com/brockrob/OpenPasswordFilter/raw/master/OPF-alpha.zip)

You will want to configure the DLL so that Windows will load it for filtering passwords.  Note that you will have to do this
on all domain controllers, as any of them may end up servicing a password change request.  Here is a link to Microsoft's
documentation for setting up a password filter:

    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms721766(v=vs.85).aspx
    
The bottom line is this:

  1. Copy `OpenPasswordFilter.dll` to `%WINDIR%\System32`
  2. Configure the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages` registry key with the DLL name
  
Note, you do not include the `.dll` extension in the registry key -- just `OpenPasswordFilter`.

Next, you will want to configure the OPF service.  You can do so as follows:

    > sc create OPF binPath= "<full path to exe>\opfservice.exe" start= boot

You can then start or stop the OPF service from the command line (as an administrator) with:
    
    > NET START OPF

or

    > NET STOP OPF

When the service is stopped, the various opf dictionary files can be updated.


Finally, create several dictionary files in the same directory where you placed opfservice.exe.

These are
- `opfmatch.txt`
- `opfcont.txt`
- `opfregex.txt`
- `opfgroups.txt`

### opfmatch.txt and opfcont.txt
These should contain one forbidden password per line, such as:

    Password1
    Password2
    Company123
    Summer15
    Summer2015
    ...

Passwords in `opfmatch.txt` will be tested for full matches, and those in `opfcont.txt` will be tested for a partial match. This
is useful for rejecting any password containing poison strings such as `password` and `welcome`. I recommend constructing a list
of bad seeds, then using hashcat rules to build `opfcont.txt` with the sort of leet mangling users are likely to try, like so:

`hashcat -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/Incisive-leetspeak.rule --stdout seedwordlist | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq > opfcont.txt`

Bear in mind that if you use a unix like system to create your wordlists, the line terminators will need changing to Windows
format:

`unix2dos opfcont.txt`

If the service fails to start, it's likely an error ingesting the wordlists, and the line number of the problem entry will be
written to the Application event log.

Or you can skip all this and use one of the installers.

   https://github.com/brockrob/OpenPasswordFilter/raw/master/OPFInstaller_x86.zip

### opfregex.txt
Similar to the opfmatch and opfconf files, include here regular expression - one per line - for invalid passwords. Example, including 'xx.*xx' will catch all passwords that have two x's followed by any text followed by two x's. Keep this list short as regular expression matching is more computationally expensive than simple matching or contains searches.

### opfgroups.txt
This file contains zero or more Active-Directory group names - one per line. These can be security or distribution groups. A user is considered to be in a group if they are a descendent child of the group. A user's password will only be checked if the user is a member of any group listed in this file. If the file is present but contains no groups then every user will be checked.

## Event Logging
The opfservice.exe application logs to the Application Event Log using codes 100, and 101. Searching the event log will identify what the opfservice is checking.

## Production Installation Details
The filter DLL bitness must match the OS, so choose correctly. .Net 3.5
is still required and the installer won't handle installing it for you because Visual Studio packaging a bootstrap package for
that version has been broken since 2008 and I didn't have the patience to roll a custom action to test the OS version and go
down the appropriate installation path (DISM vs .exe). I also can't set the reboot flag in the MSI with Visual Studio, so you'll
have to manually do that as well, but it still saves some significant legwork.

The installers include lists. The match list is rockyou.txt with every line less than ten characters stripped out, lowered,
sorted, and de-duped. The other was made as described above with hashcat rules from a seed set containing some dumb words 
I've seen people base passwords on as well as some terms relevant to my environment (company names, industry terms, etc).

If all has gone well, reboot your DC and test by using the normal GUI password reset function to choose a password that is on
your forbidden list.
